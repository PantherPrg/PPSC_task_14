# PPSC_task_14: Debug It! #1
**| difficulty: 3/10 |**

Welcome to your first Debug It Challenge! This simulates a software developer environment where you are given a piece of code to debug. Errors in the code can range anywhere from syntax, spelling, missing code blocks, etc. The complexity of the errors soley depend on the difficulty of the task. Since this is the first Debug It, the errors will be rather obvious just to get the gist of the challenge. 

Here's the prompt of what the program is attempting to solve:

The slope of a line given change in x and change in y. Very simple.
__________________________________________________________________________________
**Input**:
int x (the change in x of the slope (run))
int y (the change in y of the slope (rise))
__________________________________________________________________________________
**Output**:

int slope (of the line)
Make sure to add a newline at the end of your answer for it to match the answer format.
__________________________________________________________________________________
**optional challenge: write your code in under 0 lines**

This problem deals with simple math, and just overal debugging skills. Pretty cool. **Do your research, google is your friend.**

For additional help, either ask Paul, Joshua, Mr. Blatner, or any other staff member for assistance. We would be able to go over them during the club. **It can be an anonymous request if you would like.**
